1. The error is in `supabase/functions/evolution-webhook/phoneVariations.ts` around line 28.
2. The message suggests a syntax error, such as a missing `}` or `;` or an incomplete code block.
3. It also references what looks like XML/AI tooling syntax, which should not appear in the actual TypeScript code file.

**Step 2: Inspect the File**

Given your recent refactor and the hint in the error message, let's review the final lines of `phoneVariations.ts`. It's likely a block was accidentally left open or there was some tag or code mistakenly pasted.

**Step 3: Solution Approach**

- Ensure `phoneVariations.ts` ends cleanly, with the function properly closed and no stray XML or other invalid contents.
- Remove any `lov-write` or similar tags inside the TypeScript file—these do not belong in code files.

**Step 4: Remediate**

Let me rewrite the file ensuring it has exactly what it should—a single exported function and proper exports, with no tool/tag code, and with correct syntax.

<lov-code>
We will fully rewrite `supabase/functions/evolution-webhook/phoneVariations.ts` and validate for a correct export.

<lov-write file_path="supabase/functions/evolution-webhook/phoneVariations.ts">
// Create phone search variations.
// Can be expanded in the future for more complicated rules.
export function createPhoneSearchVariations(phone: string): string[] {
  const variations = new Set<string>();
  variations.add(phone);

  // Known patterns (example for DDD85 used in current code)
  if (phone === "85998372658") {
    variations.add("8598372658");
    variations.add("5585998372658");
    variations.add("558598372658");
  }

  // Add logic for Brazilian numbers with/without country code, 9 double, etc.
  if (phone.startsWith("55") && phone.length === 13) {
    const withoutCountryCode = phone.slice(2);
    if (
      withoutCountryCode.length === 11 &&
      withoutCountryCode[2] === "9" &&
      withoutCountryCode[3] === "9"
    ) {
      variations.add("55" + withoutCountryCode.slice(0, 2) + withoutCountryCode.slice(3));
    }
  }

  return Array.from(variations);
}
